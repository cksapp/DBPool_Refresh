# Datto.DBPool.Refresh

This PowerShell module is used to `Refresh` all child containers in Datto (Kaseya) DBPool.

This can be combined with Scheduled Tasks in Windows or a similar Cron job to automate the refresh script on a set interval.
The recommendation is ~30 - 60 minutes prior to the start of your shift.

## Installation

### Install Script

Use the following script to easily install and handle **all** dependancies.

```PowerShell
$scriptFile = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cksapp/Datto-DBPool_Refresh/refs/heads/main/src/Initialize-RefreshDBPool.ps1'; $fileName = [System.IO.Path]::GetFileName($scriptFile); $tempFile = [System.IO.Path]::Combine([System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath(), $fileName); if ($PSEdition -eq 'Desktop' -or $IsWindows) { Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force }; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($scriptFile, $tempFile); & $tempFile
```

The install [script](./src/Invoke-RefreshDBPoolInstall.ps1) is user interactive with a few prompts to set up the initial install and variables needed to automate the container refresh.

1. Copy the full script
2. Open PowerShell _(will work with both Windows PowerShell, and PowerShell)_
3. Paste the script content and enter _(sometimes it seems this may hang, in which case pressing 'Enter' or 'Spacebar' will allow continued run)_

3. Use `Set-RefreshDBPoolApiKey` to add the API key to module secret store

### Environment Override

The script is configured to check for an environment override file in the User `$HOME` directory or where specified by `Export-RefreshDBPoolModuleSetting`.

Default location in Windows is "`$HOME\RefreshDBPool`"

### Automating

The module handles automation by creating schedule task in Windows to run refresh script daily.
