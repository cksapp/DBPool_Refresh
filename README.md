# Datto.DBPool.Refresh

This PowerShell module is used to `Refresh` all child containers in Datto (Kaseya) DBPool.

This can be combined with Scheduled Tasks in Windows or a similar Cron job to automate the refresh script on a set interval.
The recommendation is ~30 - 60 minutes prior to the start of your shift.
